# Hello Future

> On February 2, 2020, GitHub will capture a snapshot of every active public repository, to be preserved in the GitHub Arctic Code Vault. This data will be stored on 3,500-foot film reels, provided and encoded by Piql, a Norwegian company that specializes in very-long-term data storage. The film technology relies on silver halides on polyester. This medium has a lifespan of 500 years as measured by the ISO; simulated aging tests indicate Piqlâ€™s film will last twice as long.

## What ?

This is just a dumb repository to store what future generation may remember or want to forget :D

If you had one last piece of code to share, what would it be ?
If you had one last word, what would it be ?

Fill free to star :sparkles: and fork :fork_and_knife: this repository before February 2, 2020 and create your own public version for posterity.

See you in 500 years


## Code for posterity

In 2020, computer still don't know how to use floating numbers :D

```js
0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3 // false
```

## One last word

"You can't have runtime errors if your code doesn't compile"
